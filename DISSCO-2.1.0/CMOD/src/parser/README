To add a new keyword:

1) Edit the Parser.l file. There are comments in the file telling you where to
add a new token. The token can take any POSIX regular expression, but for the
most part we will only add the word we want to look for. Then you need to
specify an action to be taken, within {}'s. For the most part this will just be
to return some token. The token name can be whatever you wish, as long as it
does not clash with another token.

2) Next edit the Parser.y file. There also comments here telling you where to
add the new token. The Parser.y file takes patterns based on its tokens and
rules you can specify, and then can execute arbitrary C code.

3) Then run the regenerate-parser.sh file. This builds Parser.h and Parser.cpp 
using the Parser.y and Parser.l files.

Note:
The script used to create a test parser; however it no longer is functional, so
the command to build it has been commented out of the script.
