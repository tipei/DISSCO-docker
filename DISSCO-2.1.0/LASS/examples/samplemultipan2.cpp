   * As in the previous sample file, we are creating a MultiPan
   * object that will handle 8 speakers, we set up the speaker
   * responses over time, then tell the sound to use this object
   * for spatialization.
   *
   * The difference here is in the method we call to set the
   * speaker responses.  Before, we called addEntry() which one
   * can use to explicitly set the response of individual speakers
   * at time values.  In this example though, we use addEntryLocation,
   * which is different.
   *
   * For addEntryLocation, it is assumed that you have a circular
   * ring of speakers that are evenly spread and all facing the
   * center.  In this configuration, we can talk about the focal
   * point where the sound appears to be coming from (to someone
   * sitting in the exact center of the ring).  The only tricky
   * part is that this value is represented with an angle from the
   * viewer (in radians, not degrees) and a radius from the viewer.
   * In other words, we're using polar coordinates.  For our angle
   * values, 0 means straight in front of the user (at speaker 0).
   * positive angles wrap to the user's left, negative angles wrap
   * to the user's right.  Behind the user at 180 degrees, the 
   * positive and negative angles meet up at positive pi (the
   * mathematical constant), and negative pi.  In order to use
   * pi in the program, be sure math.h is included, then use M_PI.
   * Radiuses are specified in arbitrary units that range from 0.0
   * (meaning at the center of the circle) to 1.0 (meaning at the
   * ring of the circle, where the speakers are).
