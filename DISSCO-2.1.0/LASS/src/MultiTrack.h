/**
*	A MultiTrack is basically a collection of track pointers.
*	When the MultiTrack object is deleted, it deletes each of the tracks
*	in the collection.  When it is copied or assigned, it copies the
*	underlying objects. When tracks are removed or replaced, they 
*	are not deleted.
*
*	The idea is that copying entire MultiTrack objects should be covered,
*	but editing elements in the MultiTrack objects should leave users
*	to their own object management.  Just remember, a MultiTrack owns a
*	pointer when it is added to it.
