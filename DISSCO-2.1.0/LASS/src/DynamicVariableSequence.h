/**
*  This class is designed to "put together" several DynamicVariables that then
*  act as a single DynamicVariable.  This allows easy combining of shapes
*  for sounds defined by DynamicVariables to make bigger shapes.  It also adds
*  the ability to specify whether a particular DynamicVariable plays for a
*  fixed amount of time or for a percentage of time available.  For each
*  DynamicVariableSequenceEntry that is stored in the DynamicVariableSequence,
*  the user specifies how long the Entry will play for.  Checking is done
*  to ensure that if invalid input is given, the values are adjusted
*  accordingly.  The sampledvs*.cpp files in the samples directory
*  demonstrate how checking is done.
*
*  As demonstrated in the sample files, the values for a fixed amount of time
*  are the amount of time that this DynamicVariableSequenceEntry will play for,
*  and the only reason that it would not play for this much time is if the
*  sound that it is a shape for does not play for that much time.  In this case,
*  the amount of time will get scaled to fill up the whole time available.
*
*  Also demonstrated in the sample files are the ways that flexible time is
*  assigned.  Basically, all values for flexible time are relative to one
*  another.  This is easiest explained by examples:
*
*  - DynamicVariableSequence A will play for 10 seconds and has 3 Entries:
*    - Entry 1 uses flexible time with a value of 0.1 as a "percentage."
*    - Entry 2 uses flexible time with a value of 0.4 as a "percentage."
*    - Entry 3 uses flexible time with a value of 0.5 as a "percentage."
*
*  - DynamicVariableSequence B will play for 10 seconds and has 3 Entries:
*    - Entry 1 uses flexible time with a value of 10 as a "percentage."
*    - Entry 2 uses flexible time with a value of 40 as a "percentage."
*    - Entry 3 uses flexible time with a value of 50 as a "percentage."
*
*  - DynamicVariableSequence C will play for 10 seconds and has 3 Entries:
*    - Entry 1 uses flexible time with a value of 20 as a "percentage."
*    - Entry 2 uses flexible time with a value of 80 as a "percentage."
*    - Entry 3 uses flexible time with a value of 100 as a "percentage."
*
*  Since all the "percentage" values are relative to one another, these will
*  all define the same shape.  Thus, the value of every "percentage" 
*  is normalized to whatever value all the flexible times add up to.
