/**
 *  This class is designed to allow users to specify the shape of an envelope.
 *  This is done by using a collection of the env_seg type, which can be found
 *  in Types.h. For each segment, a user must specify the x value of the right
 *  endpoint of the segment, the type of interpolation to use for the segment,
 *  and whether or not the segment has a FIXED or FLEXIBLE length. If the total 
 *  length specified by the user is greater than the sum of the lengths of the 
 *  segments, then every segment with a length type of FLEXIBLE will be scaled 
 *  up to fit the total length specified. Sample programs of how to use this 
 *  class can be found in the samples directory, named sampleenvelope*.cpp
 *
 *  \note All of the public functions of the class increment the index by 1. This means that a sample program will normally not access the dummy segment information used for the first point. In other words, getSegment(0) will actually retrieve segments_[1]. This is why the index is changed when segments_->get() is used internally by the  Envelope functions.
