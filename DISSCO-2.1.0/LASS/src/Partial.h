/**
*	Defines the Dynamic parameters that can be set for a Partial object.
*	- FREQUENCY
*		- The pitch at which a partial is heard.
*		- Set in Hz. (no bounds checking)
*	- WAVE_SHAPE
*		- How the partial changes it's amplitude over time.
*		- Envelope should start and end at y=0; otherwise "clicks" and 
*	           "pops" will be created
*	- TREMOLO_AMP
*		- The amplitude of tremolo (size of the effect).
*		- Given as a scaling factor to amplitude.
*	- TREMOLO_RATE
*		- Given in Hz. (see vibrato rate)
*	- VIBRATO_AMP
*		- The amplitude of vibrato (size of the effect).
*		- Given as a scaling factor to frequency.
*	- VIBRATO_RATE
*		- Given in Hz. (6 Hz is a "normal" vibrato)
*	- FREQUENCY_DEVIATION ****Commmented out (i.e. not used anywhere, but can be put back in)*****
*		- Specifies how randomly scaled the frequencies
*		  of this partial will be.
*		- Range [0 - 1]
*		- Could be specified as a value or as an envelope which will
*		  affect the frequency.  Exactly the same effect can be obtained
*		  by using GLISSANDO_ENV or DETUNING_ENV. See comment for
*		  glissando envelope.
*	- LOUDNESS_SCALAR
*		- Not to be set by users.
*		- This variable is set by the Loudness routines.
*		- The scaling factor is then taken into account at every sample.
*	- GLISSANDO_ENV *******Commented Out (i.e. not used anywhere, but can be put back in) *****
*		- This is a glissando envelope.  It is multiplied by the
*		- frequency at every point.  Thus, if you leave it at 1.0 (The
*		  default, it will not affect anything).  If you leave it at 1.0
*		  for most of the sound, then interpolate it down to 0.5, the 
*		  partial will trail off (by an octave down) at the end of the
*		  sound.
*		- The y values for this envelope can be any positive number.  a
*		  value of 0 will kill the sound (0 frequency), and too high of
*		  a value could make the frequency inaudible or above Nyquist
*		  (no bounds checking).
*	- DETUNING_ENV ******** (Commmented Out) *********
*		- used to gradually tune or detune a partial.  It's an envelope,
*		  and acts just like a glissando envelope, but more general.
*       - AMPTRANS_AMP_ENV
*               - used to control the value of amplitude transients
*               - the value of the amp envelope is a maximum transient modifier
*               - this value is multiplied by a random percentage and then
*                 used to modify the amplitude as follows:
*                  If the value after the percentage is applied is 0.7, then
*		   the amplitude will be 1.7 or 0.3 times its original value.
*       - AMPTRANS_RATE_ENV
*               - used to control the rate of amplitude transients
*               - the value of the rate envelope is the percentage chance of a
*                 transient occuring at that particular time
*       - FREQTRANS_AMP_ENV
*               - used to control the amplitude of frequency transients
*               - see AMPTRANS_AMP_ENV for an explanation
*       - FREQTRANS_RATE_ENV
*               - used to control the rate of frequency transients
*               - see AMPTRANS_RATE_ENV for an explanation
*       - AMPTRANS_WIDTH
*               - the width of any amplitude transient in samples
*               - defaults to 1103, or 0.025 seconds.
*       - FREQTRANS_WIDTH
*               -the width of any frequency transient in samples
*               - defaults to 1103, or 0.025 seconds.
